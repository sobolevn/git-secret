== public/private key pairs for test keys

* user1 and user2 are normal gpg key sets for user1@gitsecret.io and 
  user2@gitsecret.io. They have the passphrases 'user1pass' and 'user2pass', 
  respectively.
  user1 is not currently used.

* user3 was created by `gpg --quick-generate user3@gitsecret.io` 
  and therefore has only an email associated with it (no username).  
  It has the passphrase 'user3pass' as the tests expect.
  This user was created to fix https://github.com/sobolevn/git-secret/issues/227 ,
  "keys with no info but the email address not recognized by whoknows"

* user4 was created with `gpg --gen-key`, using the name 'user4'
  and the email address user4@gitsecret.io. As the tests expect,
  it has the passphrase 'user4pass'.  It is also set to expire on 2018-09-23.

  The public and private key for user4 were exported with
    `gpg --export --armor user4 > tests/fixtures/gpg/user4/public.key`
  and
    `gpg --export-secret-keys --armor user4 > tests/fixtures/gpg/user4/private.key`
