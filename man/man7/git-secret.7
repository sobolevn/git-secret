\fBgit\-secret\fR
.
.SH "Usage"
These steps cover the basic process of using \fBgit\-secret\fR:
.
.IP "1." 4
Before starting, make sure you have created \fBgpg\fR RSA key\-pair: public and secret key identified by your email address\.
.
.IP "2." 4
Initialize \fBgit\-secret\fR repository by running \fBgit secret init\fR command\. \fB\.gitsecret/\fR folder will be created, \fBnote\fR that \fB\.gitsecret/\fR folder should \fBnot\fR be ignored \fIhttps://github\.com/sobolevn/git\-secret/issues/39\fR\.
.
.IP "3." 4
Add first user to the system by running \fBgit secret tell your@gpg\.email\fR\.
.
.IP "4." 4
Now it\'s time to add files you wish to encrypt inside the \fBgit\-secret\fR repository\. It can be done by running \fBgit secret add <filenames\.\.\.>\fR command\. Make sure these files are ignored, otherwise \fBgit\-secret\fR won\'t allow you to add them, as these files will be stored unencrypted\.
.
.IP "5." 4
When done, run \fBgit secret hide\fR all files, which you have added by \fBgit secret add\fR command will be encrypted with added public\-keys by the \fBgit secret tell\fR command\. Now it is safe to commit your changes\. \fBBut\fR\. It\'s recommended to add \fBgit secret hide\fR command to your \fBpre\-commit\fR hook, so you won\'t miss any changes\.
.
.IP "6." 4
Now decrypt files with \fBgit secret reveal\fR command\. It will ask you for your password\. And you\'re done!
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "I want to add someone to the repository"
.
.IP "1." 4
Get their \fBgpg\fR public\-key\. \fBYou won\'t need their secret key\.\fR
.
.IP "2." 4
Import this key inside your \fBgpg\fR by running \fBgpg \-\-import KEY_NAME\fR
.
.IP "3." 4
Now add this person to the \fBgit\-secret\fR by running \fBgit secret tell persons@email\.id\fR
.
.IP "4." 4
Reencypt the files, now they will be able to decrypt them with their secret key\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Note, that it is possible to add yourself to the system without decrypting existing files\. It will be possible to decrypt them after reencrypting them with the new keyring\. So, if you don\'t want unexpected keys added, make sure to configure some server\-side security policy with the \fBpre\-receive\fR hook\.
.
.SH "Configuration"
You can configure several things to suit your workflow better\. To do so, just set the required variable to the value you need\. This can be done in your shell environment file or with the each \fBgit\-secret\fR command\.
.
.P
These settings are available to be changed:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB$SECRETS_GPG_COMMAND\fR \- sets the \fBgpg\fR alternatives, defaults to \fBgpg\fR\. It can be changed to \fBgpg\fR, \fBgpg2\fR, \fBpgp\fR, \fB/usr/local/gpg\fR or any other value\. After doing so rerun tests to be sure, that it won\'t break anything\. Tested to be working with: \fBgpg\fR, \fBgpg2\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB$SECRETS_EXTENSION\fR \- sets the secret files extension, defaults to \fB\.secret\fR\. It can be changed to any valid file extension\.
.
.IP "" 0
