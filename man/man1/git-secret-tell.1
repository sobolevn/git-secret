.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBgit\-secret\-tell\fR receives an email address as an input, searches for the \fBgpg\fR\-key in the \fBgpg\fR\'s \fBhomedir\fR by this email, then import a person\'s public key into the \fBgit\-secret\fR\'s inner keychain\. Since this moment this person can encrypt new files with the keyring which contains his key\. But he cannot decrypt the old files, which were already encrypted without his key\. They should be reencrypted with the new keyring by someone, who has the unencrypted files\.
