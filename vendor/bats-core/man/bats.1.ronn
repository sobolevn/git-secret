bats(1) -- Bash Automated Testing System
========================================


SYNOPSIS
--------

Usage: bats [OPTIONS] <tests>
       bats [-h | -v]

  <tests> is the path to a Bats test file, or the path to a directory
  containing Bats test files (ending with ".bats")


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Bats is a TAP-compliant testing framework for Bash. It provides a simple
way to verify that the UNIX programs you write behave as expected.

A Bats test file is a Bash script with special syntax for defining
test cases. Under the hood, each test case is just a function with a
description.

Test cases consist of standard shell commands. Bats makes use of
Bash's `errexit` (`set -e`) option when running test cases. If every
command in the test case exits with a `0` status code (success), the
test passes. In this way, each line is an assertion of truth.

See `bats`(7) for more information on writing Bats tests.


RUNNING TESTS
-------------

To run your tests, invoke the `bats` interpreter with a path to a test
file. The file's test cases are run sequentially and in isolation. If
all the test cases pass, `bats` exits with a `0` status code. If there
are any failures, `bats` exits with a `1` status code.

You can invoke the `bats` interpreter with multiple test file arguments,
or with a path to a directory containing multiple `.bats` files. Bats
will run each test file individually and aggregate the results. If any
test case fails, `bats` exits with a `1` status code.


OPTIONS
-------

  * `-c`, `--count`:
    Count the number of test cases without running any tests
  * `-f`, `--filter <regex>`:
    Filter test cases by names matching the regular expression
  * `-F`, `--formatter <type>`:
    Switch between formatters: pretty (default), tap (default w/o term), tap13, junit
  * `-h`, `--help`:
    Display this help message
  * `-j`, `--jobs <jobs>`:
    Number of parallel jobs (requires GNU parallel)
  * `--no-tempdir-cleanup`:
    Preserve test output temporary directory
  * `--no-parallelize-across-files`
    Serialize test file execution instead of running them in parallel (requires --jobs >1)
  * `--no-parallelize-within-files`
    Serialize test execution within files instead of running them in parallel (requires --jobs >1)
  * `--report-formatter <type>`:
    Switch between reporters (same options as --formatter)
  * `-o`, `--output <dir>`:
    Directory to write report files
  * `-p`, `--pretty`:
    Shorthand for "--formatter pretty"
  * `-r`, `--recursive`:
    Include tests in subdirectories
  * `-t`, `--tap`:
    Shorthand for "--formatter tap"
  * `-T`, `--timing`:
    Add timing information to tests
  * `-v`, `--version`:
    Display the version number


OUTPUT
------

When you run Bats from a terminal, you'll see output as each test is
performed, with a check-mark next to the test's name if it passes or
an "X" if it fails.

    $ bats addition.bats
     ✓ addition using bc
     ✓ addition using dc

    2 tests, 0 failures

If Bats is not connected to a terminal--in other words, if you run it
from a continuous integration system or redirect its output to a
file--the results are displayed in human-readable, machine-parsable
TAP format. You can force TAP output from a terminal by invoking Bats
with the `--tap` option.

    $ bats --tap addition.bats
    1..2
    ok 1 addition using bc
    ok 2 addition using dc


EXIT STATUS
-----------

The `bats` interpreter exits with a value of `0` if all test cases pass,
or `1` if one or more test cases fail.
